QLORA backpropagates gradi-\\nents through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters (LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms\\nall previous openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3%\\nof the performance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning\\non a single GPU. QLORA introduces a number of innovations to save memory\\nwithout sacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that\\nis information theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) Double\\nQuantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the quantization\\nconstants, and (c) Paged Optimizers to manage memory spikes. We use QLORA\\nto finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of instruction\\nfollowing and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets, multiple model\\ntypes (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to run with regular\\nfinetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results show that QLoRA\\nfinetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to state-of-the-art results, even\\nwhen using smaller models than the previous SoTA. We provide a detailed analysis\\nof chatbot performance based on both human and GPT-4 evaluations showing that\\nGPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable alternative to human evaluation. Fur-\\nthermore, we find that current chatbot benchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately\\nevaluate the performance levels of chatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates\\nwhere Guanaco fails compared to ChatGPT. We release all of our models and code,\\nincluding CUDA kernels for 4-bit training.2\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nFinetuning large language models (LLMs) is a highly effective way to improve their performance,\\n[40, 62, 43, 61, 59, 37] and to add desirable or remove undesirable behaviors [43, 2, 4]. However,\\nfinetuning very large models is prohibitively expensive; regular 16-bit finetuning of a LLaMA 65B\\nparameter model [57] requires more than 780 GB of GPU memory. While recent quantization\\nmethods can reduce the memory footprint of LLMs [14, 13, 18, 66], such techniques only work for\\ninference and break down during training [65].\\nWe demonstrate for the first time that it is possible to finetune a quantized 4-bit model without any\\nperformance degradation. Our method, QLORA, uses a novel high-precision technique to quantize\\na pretrained model to 4-bit, then adds a small set of learnable Low-rank Adapter weights [28]\\n‚àóEqual contribution.\\n2https://github.com/artidoro/qlora and https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes\\nPreprint.

This marks a significant\\nshift in accessibility of LLM finetuning: now the\\nlargest publicly available models to date finetunable\\non a single GPU. Using QLORA, we train the Gua-\\nnaco family of models, with the second best model\\nreaching 97.8% of the performance level of ChatGPT\\non the Vicuna [10] benchmark, while being trainable\\nin less than 12 hours on a single consumer GPU;\\nusing a single professional GPU over 24 hours we\\nachieve 99.3% with our largest model, essentially\\nclosing the gap to ChatGPT on the Vicuna bench-\\nmark. When deployed, our smallest Guanaco model\\n(7B parameters) requires just 5 GB of memory and outperforms a 26 GB Alpaca model by more than\\n20 percentage points on the Vicuna benchmark (Table 6).\\nQLORA introduces multiple innovations designed to reduce memory use without sacrificing per-\\nformance: (1) 4-bit NormalFloat, an information theoretically optimal quantization data type for\\nnormally distributed data that yields better empirical results than 4-bit Integers and 4-bit Floats.\\n(2) Double Quantization, a method that quantizes the quantization constants, saving an average\\nof about 0.37 bits per parameter (approximately 3 GB for a 65B model). (3) Paged Optimizers,\\nusing NVIDIA unified memory to avoid the gradient checkpointing memory spikes that occur when\\nprocessing a mini-batch with a long sequence length. We combine these contributions into a better\\ntuned LoRA approach that includes adapters at every network layer and thereby avoids almost all of\\nthe accuracy tradeoffs seen in prior work.\\nQLORA‚Äôs efficiency enables us to perform an in-depth study of instruction finetuning and chatbot\\nperformance on model scales that would be impossible using regular finetuning due to memory\\noverhead. Therefore, we train more than 1,000 models across several instruction tuning datasets,\\nmodel architectures, and sizes between 80M to 65B parameters. In addition to showing that QLORA\\nrecovers 16-bit performance (¬ß4) and training a state-of-the-art chatbot, Guanaco, (¬ß5), we also\\nanalyze trends in the trained models. First, we find that data quality is far more important than\\ndataset size, e.g., a 9k sample dataset (OASST1) outperformed a 450k sample dataset (FLAN v2,\\nsubsampled) on chatbot performance, even when both are meant to support instruction following\\ngeneralization. Second, we show that strong Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)\\nbenchmark performance does not imply strong Vicuna chatbot benchmark performance and vice\\nversa‚Äîin other words, dataset suitability matters more than size for a given task.\\nFurthermore, we also provide a extensive analysis of chatbot performance that uses both human\\nraters and GPT-4 for evaluation. We use tournament-style benchmarking where models compete\\nagainst each other in matches to produce the best response for a given prompt. The winner of a\\nmatch is judged by either GPT-4 or human annotators. The tournament results are aggregated into\\nElo scores [16, 17] which determine the ranking of chatbot performance. We find that GPT-4 and\\nhuman evaluations largely agree on the rank of model performance in the tournaments, but we also\\nfind there are instances of strong disagreement. As such, we highlight that model-based evaluation\\nwhile providing a cheap alternative to human-annotation also has its uncertainties.\\nWe augment our chatbot benchmark results with a qualitative analysis of Guanaco models. Our analy-\\nsis highlights success and failure cases that were not captured by the quantitative benchmarks.\\nWe release all model generations with human and GPT-4 annotations to facilitate further study. We\\nopen-source our codebase and CUDA kernels and integrate our methods into the Hugging Face\\ntransformers stack [64], making them easily accessible to all. We release a collection of adapters\\nfor 7/13/33/65B size models, trained on 8 different instruction following datasets, for a total of 32\\ndifferent open sourced, finetuned models.\\n2\\nFigure 1: Different finetuning methods and their memory requirements. QLORA improves over LoRA by\\nquantizing the transformer model to 4-bit precision and using paged optimizers to handle memory spikes.\\n2\\nBackground\\nBlock-wise k-bit Quantization\\nQuantization is the process of discretizing an input from a rep-\\nresentation that holds more information to a representation with less information. It often means\\ntaking a data type with more bits and converting it to fewer bits, for example from 32-bit floats to\\n8-bit Integers. To ensure that the entire range of the low-bit data type is used, the input data type is\\ncommonly rescaled into the target data type range through normalization by the absolute maximum\\nof the input elements, which are usually structured as a tensor. For example, quantizing a 32-bit\\nFloating Point (FP32) tensor into a Int8 tensor with range [‚àí127, 127]:\\nXInt8 = round\\n\\x12\\n127\\nabsmax(XFP32)XFP32\\n\\x13\\n= round(cFP32 ¬∑ XFP32),\\n(1)\\nwhere c is the quantization constant or quantization scale. Dequantization is the inverse:\\ndequant(cFP32, XInt8) = XInt8\\ncFP32 = XFP32\\n(2)\\nThe problem with this approach is that if a large magnitude value (i.e., an outlier) occurs in the input\\ntensor, then the quantization bins‚Äîcertain bit combinations‚Äîare not utilized well with few or no\\nnumbers quantized in some bins. To prevent the outlier issue, a common approach is to chunk the\\ninput tensor into blocks that are independently quantized, each with their own quantization constant c.\\nThis can be formalized as follows: We chunk the input tensor X ‚ààRb√óh into n contiguous blocks of\\nsize B by flattening the input tensor and slicing the linear segment into n = (b √ó h)/B blocks. We\\nquantize these blocks independently with Equation 1 to create a quantized tensor and n quantization\\nconstants ci.\\nLow-rank Adapters\\nLow-rank Adapter (LoRA) finetuning [28] is a method that reduces memory\\nrequirements by using a small set of trainable parameters, often termed adapters, while not updating\\nthe full model parameters which remain fixed. Gradients during stochastic gradient descent are\\npassed through the fixed pretrained model weights to the adapter, which is updated to optimize the\\nloss function. LoRA augments a linear projection through an additional factorized projection. Given\\na projection XW = Y with X ‚ààRb√óh, W ‚ààRh√óo LoRA computes:\\nY = XW + sXL1L2,\\n(3)\\nwhere L1 ‚ààRh√ór and L2 ‚ààRr√óo, and s is a scalar.\\nMemory Requirement of Parameter-Efficient Finetuning\\nOne important point of discussion is\\nthe memory requirement of LoRA during training both in terms of the number and size of adapters\\nused. Since the memory footprint of LoRA is so minimal, we can use more adapters to improve\\nperformance without significantly increasing the total memory used. While LoRA was designed as a\\n3\\nParameter Efficient Finetuning (PEFT) method, most of the memory footprint for LLM finetuning\\ncomes from activation gradients and not from the learned LoRA parameters. For a 7B LLaMA\\nmodel trained on FLAN v2 with a batch size of 1, with LoRA weights equivalent to commonly used\\n0.2% of the original model weights[28, 37], the LoRA input gradients have a memory footprint\\nof 567 MB while the LoRA parameters take up only 26 MB. With gradient checkpointing [9], the\\ninput gradients reduce to an average of 18 MB per sequence making them more memory intensive\\nthan all LoRA weights combined. In comparison, the 4-bit base model consumes 5,048 MB of\\nmemory. This highlights that gradient checkpointing is important but also that aggressively reducing\\nthe amount of LoRA parameter yields only minor memory benefits. This means we can use more\\nadapters without significantly increasing the overall training memory footprint (see Appendix G\\nfor a detailed breakdown). As discussed later, this is crucial for recovering full 16-bit precision\\nperformance.\\n3\\nQLORA Finetuning\\nQLORA achieves high-fidelity 4-bit finetuning via two techniques we propose‚Äî4-bit NormalFloat\\n(NF4) quantization and Double Quantization. Additionally, we introduce Paged Optimizers, to\\nprevent memory spikes during gradient checkpointing from causing out-of-memory errors that have\\ntraditionally made finetuning on a single machine difficult for large models.\\nQLORA has one low-precision storage data type, in our case usually 4-bit, and one computation data\\ntype that is usually BFloat16. In practice, this means whenever a QLORA weight tensor is used, we\\ndequantize the tensor to BFloat16, and then perform a matrix multiplication in 16-bit.\\nWe now discuss the components of QLORA followed by a formal definition of QLORA.\\n4-bit NormalFloat Quantization\\nThe NormalFloat (NF) data type builds on Quantile Quantization\\n[15] which is an information-theoretically optimal data type that ensures each quantization bin has an\\nequal number of values assigned from the input tensor. Quantile quantization works by estimating\\nthe quantile of the input tensor through the empirical cumulative distribution function.\\nThe main limitation of quantile quantization is that the process of quantile estimation is expensive.\\nTherefore fast quantile approximation algorithms, such as SRAM quantiles [15], are used to estimate\\nthem. Due to the approximate nature of these quantile estimation algorithms, the data type has large\\nquantization errors for outliers, which are often the most important values.\\nExpensive quantile estimates and approximation errors can be avoided when input tensors come from\\na distribution fixed up to a quantization constant. In such cases, input tensors have the same quantiles\\nmaking exact quantile estimation computationally feasible.\\nSince pretrained neural network weights usually have a zero-centered normal distribution with\\nstandard deviation œÉ (see Appendix F), we can transform all weights to a single fixed distribution by\\nscaling œÉ such that the distribution fits exactly into the range of our data type. For our data type, we\\nset the arbitrary range [‚àí1, 1]. As such, both the quantiles for the data type and the neural network\\nweights need to be normalized into this range.\\nThe information theoretically optimal data type for zero-mean normal distributions with arbitrary\\nstandard deviations œÉ in the range [‚àí1, 1] is computed as follows: (1) estimate the 2k + 1 quantiles\\nof a theoretical N(0, 1) distribution to obtain a k-bit quantile quantization data type for normal distri-\\nbutions, (2) take this data type and normalize its values into the [‚àí1, 1] range, (3) quantize an input\\nweight tensor by normalizing it into the [‚àí1, 1] range through absolute maximum rescaling.\\nOnce the weight range and data type range match, we can quantize as usual. Step (3) is equivalent to\\nrescaling the standard deviation of the weight tensor to match the standard deviation of the k-bit data\\ntype. More formally, we estimate the 2k values qi of the data type as follows:\\nqi = 1\\n2\\n\\x12\\nQX\\n\\x12\\ni\\n2k + 1\\n\\x13\\n+ QX\\n\\x12 i + 1\\n2k + 1\\n\\x13\\x13\\n,\\n(4)\\nwhere QX(¬∑) is the quantile function of the standard normal distribution N(0, 1). A problem for\\na symmetric k-bit quantization is that this approach does not have an exact representation of zero,\\nwhich is an important property to quantize padding and other zero-valued elements with no error. To\\n4\\nensure a discrete zeropoint of 0 and to use all 2k bits for a k-bit datatype, we create an asymmetric\\ndata type by estimating the quantiles qi of two ranges qi: 2k‚àí1 for the negative part and 2k‚àí1 + 1 for\\nthe positive part and then we unify these sets of qi and remove one of the two zeros that occurs in both\\nsets. We term the resulting data type that has equal expected number of values in each quantization bin\\nk-bit NormalFloat (NFk), since the data type is information-theoretically optimal for zero-centered\\nnormally distributed data. The exact values of this data type can be found in Appendix E.\\nDouble Quantization\\nWe introduce Double Quantization (DQ), the process of quantizing the\\nquantization constants for additional memory savings. While a small blocksize is required for precise\\n4-bit quantization [13], it also has a considerable memory overhead. For example, using 32-bit\\nconstants and a blocksize of 64 for W, quantization constants add 32/64 = 0.5 bits per parameter on\\naverage. Double Quantization helps reduce the memory footprint of quantization constants.\\nMore specifically, Double Quantization treats quantization constants cFP32\\n2\\nof the first quantization\\nas inputs to a second quantization. This second step yields the quantized quantization constants\\ncFP8\\n2\\nand the second level of quantization constants cFP32\\n1\\n. We use 8-bit Floats with a blocksize of\\n256 for the second quantization as no performance degradation is observed for 8-bit quantization,\\nin line with results from Dettmers and Zettlemoyer [13]. Since the cFP32\\n2\\nare positive, we subtract\\nthe mean from c2 before quantization to center the values around zero and make use of symmetric\\nquantization. On average, for a blocksize of 64, this quantization reduces the memory footprint per\\nparameter from 32/64 = 0.5 bits, to 8/64 + 32/(64 ¬∑ 256) = 0.127 bits, a reduction of 0.373 bits\\nper parameter.\\nPaged Optimizers\\nuse the NVIDIA unified memory 3 feature wich does automatic page-to-page\\ntransfers between the CPU and GPU for error-free GPU processing in the scenario where the GPU\\noccasionally runs out-of-memory. The feature works like regular memory paging between CPU RAM\\nand the disk. We use this feature to allocate paged memory for the optimizer states which are then\\nautomatically evicted to CPU RAM when the GPU runs out-of-memory and paged back into GPU\\nmemory when the memory is needed in the optimizer update step.\\nQLORA.\\nUsing the components described above, we define QLORA for a single linear layer in\\nthe quantized base model with a single LoRA adapter as follows:\\nYBF16 = XBF16doubleDequant(cFP32\\n1\\n, ck-bit\\n2\\n, WNF4) + XBF16LBF16\\n1\\nLBF16\\n2\\n,\\n(5)\\nwhere doubleDequant(¬∑) is defined as:\\ndoubleDequant(cFP32\\n1\\n, ck-bit\\n2\\n, Wk-bit) = dequant(dequant(cFP32\\n1\\n, ck-bit\\n2\\n), W4bit) = WBF16,\\n(6)\\nWe use NF4 for W and FP8 for c2. We use a blocksize of 64 for W for higher quantization precision\\nand a blocksize of 256 for c2 to conserve memory.\\nFor parameter updates only the gradient with respect to the error for the adapters weights ‚àÇE\\n‚àÇLi are\\nneeded, and not for 4-bit weights ‚àÇE\\n‚àÇW. However, the calculation of ‚àÇE\\n‚àÇLi entails the calculation of ‚àÇX\\n‚àÇW\\nwhich proceeds via equation (5) with dequantization from storage WNF4 to computation data type\\nWBF16 to calculate the derivative ‚àÇX\\n‚àÇW in BFloat16 precision.\\nTo summarize, QLORA has one storage data type (usually 4-bit NormalFloat) and a computation\\ndata type (16-bit BrainFloat). We dequantize the storage data type to the computation data type\\nto perform the forward and backward pass, but we only compute weight gradients for the LoRA\\nparameters which use 16-bit BrainFloat.\\n4\\nQLoRA vs. Standard Finetuning\\nWe have discussed how QLoRA works and how it can significantly reduce the required memory for\\nfinetuning models. The main question now is whether QLoRA can perform as well as full-model\\nfinetuning. Furthermore, we want to analyze the components of QLoRA including the impact of\\nNormalFloat4 over standard Float4. The following sections will discuss the experiments that aimed\\nat answering these questions.\\n3https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide\\n5\\nExperimental setup.\\nWe consider three architectures (encoder, encoder-decoder, and decoder only)\\nand compare QLoRA with 16-bit adapter-finetuning and with full-finetuning for models up to 3B. Our\\nevaluations include GLUE [58] with RoBERTa-large [38], Super-NaturalInstructions (TKInstruct)\\n[61] with T5 [49], and 5-shot MMLU [24] after finetuning LLaMA on Flan v2 [39] and Alpaca\\n[55]. To additionally study the advantages of NF4 over other 4-bit data types, we use the setup of\\nDettmers and Zettlemoyer [13] and measure post-quantization zero-shot accuracy and perplexity\\nacross different models (OPT [72], LLaMA [57], BLOOM [52], Pythia [7]) for model sizes 125m -\\n13B. We provide more details in the results section for each particular setup to make the results more\\nreadable.

We do, however, perform an analysis of the\\nruntime of paged optimizers for 65B models on\\n48GB GPUs and find that with a batch size of 16,\\npaged optimizers provide the same training speed\\nas regular optimizers. Future work should measure\\nand characterize under what circumstances slow-\\ndowns occur from the paging process.\\nDefault LoRA hyperparameters do not match 16-\\nbit performance\\nWhen using the standard prac-\\ntice of applying LoRA to query and value attention\\nprojection matrices [28], we are not able to replicate\\nfull finetuning performance for large base models.\\nAs shown in Figure 2 for LLaMA 7B finetuning on\\nAlpaca, we find that the most critical LoRA hyper-\\nparameter is how many LoRA adapters are used in\\ntotal and that LoRA on all linear transformer block\\nlayers are required to match full finetuning perfor-\\nmance. Other LoRA hyperparameters, such as the\\nprojection dimension r, do not affect performance (see Appendix A).\\n1010\\n1011\\nT\\notal model bits\\n0.60\\n0.61\\n0.62\\n0.63\\n0.64\\n0.65\\n0.66\\n0.67\\nMean zeroshot accuracy\\n4-bit LLaMA\\nFloat\\nNFloat\\nNFloat + DQ\\nData type\\nFigure 3: Mean zero-shot accuracy over Wino-\\ngrande, HellaSwag, PiQA, Arc-Easy, and Arc-\\nChallenge using LLaMA models with different 4-bit\\ndata types.

This raises the crucial question of whether the lost performance can be\\nrecovered by conducting 4-bit adapter finetuning. We test this for two setups.\\nTable 2: Pile Common Crawl mean\\nperplexity for different data types\\nfor 125M to 13B OPT, BLOOM,\\nLLaMA, and Pythia models.\\nData type\\nMean PPL\\nInt4\\n34.34\\nFloat4 (E2M1)\\n31.07\\nFloat4 (E3M0)\\n29.48\\nNFloat4 + DQ\\n27.41\\nThe first focuses on a comparison with full 16-bit finetuning\\nof RoBERTA and T5 models sized 125M to 3B parameters on\\nGLUE and the Super-NaturalInstructions dataset. Results are\\nshown in Table 3. In both datasets, we observe that 16-bit, 8-bit,\\nand 4-bit adapter methods replicate the performance of the fully\\nfinetuned 16-bit baseline. This suggests that the performance lost\\ndue to the imprecise quantization can be fully recovered through\\nadapter finetuning after quantization.\\nFor our second setup, since full finetuning models at and beyond\\n11B parameters requires more than one server of high memory\\nGPUs, we continue to test whether 4-bit QLORA can match\\n16-bit LoRA at the 7B to 65B parameter scales. To this end, we\\nfinetune LLaMA 7B through 65B on two instruction following\\ndatasets, Alpaca and FLAN v2, and evaluate on the MMLU benchmark via 5-shot accuracy. Results\\nare shown in Table 4 where we see that NF4 with double quantization fully recovers the 16-bit\\nLoRA MMLU performance. In addition, we also note that QLORA with FP4 lags behind the 16-bit\\nbrain float LoRA baseline by about 1 percentage point. This corroborates both our findings that (1)\\nQLORA with NF4 replicates both 16-bit full finetuning and 16-bit LoRA finetuning performance,\\nand (2) NF4 is superior to FP4 in terms of quantization precision.\\nSummary\\nOur results consistently show that 4-bit QLORA with NF4 data type matches 16-\\nbit full finetuning and 16-bit LoRA finetuning performance on academic benchmarks with well-\\nestablished evaluation setups. We have also shown that NF4 is more effective than FP4 and that\\ndouble quantization does not degrade performance. Combined, this forms compelling evidence that\\n4-bit QLORA tuning reliably yields results matching 16-bit methods.\\nIn line with previous work on quantization [13], our MMLU and Elo results indicate that with a given\\nfinetuning and inference resource budget it is beneficial to increase the number of parameters in the\\nbase model while decreasing their precision. This highlights the importance of efficiency benefits\\nfrom QLORA. Since we did not observe performance degradation compared to full-finetuning in\\nour experiments with 4-bit finetuning, this raises the question of where the performance-precision\\ntrade-off exactly lies for QLoRA tuning, which we leave to future work to explore.\\nWe proceed to investigate instruction tuning at scales that would be impossible to explore with full\\n16-bit finetuning on academic research hardware.\\n5\\nPushing the Chatbot State-of-the-art with QLoRA\\nHaving established that 4-bit QLORA matches 16-bit performance across scales, tasks, and datasets\\nwe conduct an in-depth study of instruction finetuning up to the largest open-source language models\\navailable for research.

We include datasets obtained through crowd-sourcing (OASST1 [31],\\nHH-RLHF [4]), distillation from instruction-tuned models (Alpaca [55], self-instruct [59], unnatural-\\ninstructions [26]), corpora aggregations (FLAN v2 [12]), as well as hybrids (Chip2 [32], Long-\\nform [30]). These datasets cover different languages, data sizes, and licenses.\\nTraining Setup\\nTo avoid confounding effects from different training objectives, we perform QLoRA\\nfinetuning with cross-entropy loss (supervised learning) without reinforcement learning, even for\\ndatasets that include human judgments of different responses. For datasets that have a clear distinction\\nbetween instruction and response, we finetune only on the response (see ablations in Appendix B).\\nFor OASST1 and HH-RLHF, multiple responses are available. We then select the top response at\\nevery level of the conversation tree and finetune on the full selected conversation, including the\\ninstructions. In all of our experiments, we use NF4 QLORA with double quantization and paged\\noptimizers to prevent memory spikes during gradient checkpointing. We do small hyperparameter\\nsearches for the 13B and 33B LLaMA models and we find that all hyperparameter settings found\\nat 7B generalize (including number of epochs) except learning rate and batch size. We halve the\\nlearning rate for 33B and 65B while doubling the batch size.\\nBaselines\\nWe compare our models to both research (Vicuna [10] and Open Assistant [31]) and\\ncommercial (GPT-4 [42], GPT-3.5-turbo and Bard) chatbot systems. The Open Assistant model is\\na LLaMA 33B model finetuned with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) on\\nthe same OASST1 dataset that we experiment with. Vicuna does full fine-tuning of LLaMA 13B\\non proprietary user-shared conversations from ShareGPT and is thus the result of distillation from\\nOpenAI GPT models.\\n5.2\\nEvaluation\\nTable 5: MMLU 5-shot test results for different\\nsizes of LLaMA finetuned on the corresponding\\ndatasets using QLoRA.\\nDataset\\n7B\\n13B\\n33B\\n65B\\nLLaMA no tuning\\n35.1\\n46.9\\n57.8\\n63.4\\nSelf-Instruct\\n36.4\\n33.3\\n53.0\\n56.7\\nLongform\\n32.1\\n43.2\\n56.6\\n59.7\\nChip2\\n34.5\\n41.6\\n53.6\\n59.8\\nHH-RLHF\\n34.9\\n44.6\\n55.8\\n60.1\\nUnnatural Instruct\\n41.9\\n48.1\\n57.3\\n61.3\\nGuanaco (OASST1)\\n36.6\\n46.4\\n57.0\\n62.2\\nAlpaca\\n38.8\\n47.8\\n57.3\\n62.5\\nFLAN v2\\n44.5\\n51.4\\n59.2\\n63.9\\nFollowing common practice, we use the MMLU (Mas-\\nsively Multitask Language Understanding) benchmark\\n[24] to measure performance on a range of language un-\\nderstanding tasks. This is a multiple-choice benchmark\\ncovering 57 tasks including elementary mathematics,\\nUS history, computer science, law, and more. We report\\n5-shot test accuracy.\\nWe also test generative language capabilities through\\nboth automated and human evaluations. This second\\nset of evaluations relies on queries curated by humans\\nand aims at measuring the quality of model responses.\\nWhile this is a more realistic testbed for chatbot model\\nperformance and is growing in popularity, there is no\\ncommonly accepted protocol in the literature. We de-\\nscribe below our proposed setup, using nucleus sampling with p = 0.9 and temperature 0.7 in all\\ncases.\\n8\\nBenchmark Data\\nWe evaluate on two curated datasets of queries (questions): the Vicuna prompts\\n[10] and the OASST1 validation dataset [31]. We use the Vicuna prompts, a set of 80 prompts from a\\ndiverse set of categories, without modifications. The OASST1 dataset is a multilingual collection of\\ncrowd-sourced multiturn dialogs between a user and an assistant. We select all user messages in the\\nvalidation dataset as queries and include previous turns in the prompt. This procedure leads to 953\\nunique user queries. We term these two datasets the Vicuna and OA benchmarks.\\nAutomated Evaluation\\nFirst, based on the evaluation protocol introduced by Chiang et al. [10],\\nwe use GPT-4 to rate the performance of different systems against ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 Turbo) on the\\nVicuna benchmark. Given a query along with ChatGPT‚Äôs and a model‚Äôs responses, GPT-4 is prompted\\nto assign a score out of ten to both responses and provide an explanation. The overall performance of\\na model is calculated as a percentage of the score that ChatGPT achieved. Note this relative score\\ncan be higher than 100% if the model achieves a higher absolute score than ChatGPT. We find a\\nsignificant ordering effect with GPT-4 increasing the score of the response occurring earlier in the\\nprompt. To control for such effects, we recommend reporting the mean score over both orders.\\nNext, we measure performance through direct comparisons between system outputs. We simplify\\nthe rating scheme to a three-class labeling problem that accounts for ties. We prompt GPT-4 to\\npick the best response or declare a tie and provide an explanation. We conduct these head-to-head\\ncomparisons on all permutations of pairs of systems on both the Vicuna and OA benchmarks.\\nHuman Evaluation\\nWhile recent work indicates generative models can be effectively employed\\nfor system evaluations [19], the reliability GPT-4 ratings to assess chatbot performance is, to our\\nknowledge, yet to be proven to correlate with human judgments. Therefore, we run two parallel\\nhuman evaluations on the Vicuna benchmark matching both automated evaluation protocols described\\nabove. We use Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) and get two human annotators for comparisons to\\nChatGPT and three annotators for pairwise comparisons.\\nElo Rating\\nWith both human and automated pairwise comparisons, we create a tournament-style\\ncompetition where models compete against each other. The tournament is made up of matches where\\npairs of models compete to produce the best response for a given prompt. This is similar to how Bai\\net al. [4] and Chiang et al. [10] compare models, but we also employ GPT-4 ratings in addition to\\nhuman ratings. We randomly sample from the set of labeled comparisons to compute Elo [16, 17].\\nElo rating, which is widely used in chess and other games, is a measure of the expected win-rate\\nrelative to an opponent‚Äôs win rate, for example, an Elo of 1100 vs 1000 means the Elo 1100 player\\nhas an expected win-rate of approximately 65% against the Elo 1000 opponent; a 1000 vs 1000 or\\n1100 vs 1100 match results in an expected win-rate of 50%. The Elo rating changes after each match\\nproportionally to the expected outcome, that is, an unexpected upset leads to a large change in Elo\\nrating while an expected outcome leads to a small change. Over time, Elo ratings approximately\\nmatch the skill of each player at playing the game. We start with a score of 1,000 and use K = 32.\\nSimilar to Chiang et al. [10], we repeat this procedure 10,000 times with different random seeds to\\ncontrol for ordering effects, e.g., the effect of which model pairs compete with each other first.\\n5.3\\nGuanaco: QLORA trained on OASST1 is a State-of-the-art Chatbot\\nBased on our automated and human evaluations, we find that the top QLORA tuned model, Guanaco\\n65B, which we finetune on a variant of OASST1, is the best-performing open-source chatbot model\\nand offers performance competitive to ChatGPT. When compared to GPT-4, Guanaco 65B and 33B\\nhave an expected win probability of 30%, based on Elo rating from human annotators system-level\\npairwise comparisons - the highest reported to date.\\nThe Vicuna benchmark [10] results relative to ChatGPT are shown in Table 6. We find that Guanaco\\n65B is the best-performing model after GPT-4, achieving 99.3% performance relative to ChatGPT.\\nGuanaco 33B has more parameters than the Vicuna 13B model, but uses only 4-bit precision for its\\nweights and is thus much more memory efficient at 21 GB vs 26 GB, providing a three percentage\\npoints of improvement over Vicuna 13B. Furthermore, Guanaco 7B easily fits on modern phones at a\\n5 GB footprint while still scoring nearly 20 percentage points higher than Alpaca 13B.\\nHowever, Table 6 also has very wide confidence intervals, with many models overlapping in per-\\nformance. We hypothesize that this uncertainty comes from the lack of clear specification of scale,\\ne.g., it is unclear what 8 on a 10 point scale means across different scenarios. As such, we instead\\nrecommend using the Elo ranking method [16], based on pairwise judgments from human annotators\\nand GPT-4 to avoid the problem of grounding an absolute scale. Elo ratings of the most competitive\\n9\\nTable 6: Zero-shot Vicuna benchmark scores as a percentage of the score obtained by ChatGPT evaluated by\\nGPT-4.

We note that human and GPT-4 ranking of models on the Vicuna\\nbenchmark disagree partially, particularly for Guanaco 7B, but are consistent for most models with\\na Kendall Tau of œÑ = 0.43 and Spearman rank correlation of r = 0.55 at the system level. At the\\nexample level, the agreement between GPT-4 and human annotators‚Äô majority vote is weaker with\\nFleiss Œ∫ = 0.25. Overall, this shows a moderate agreement between system-level judgments by\\nGPT-4 and human annotators, and thus that model-based evaluation represents a somewhat reliable\\nalternative to human evaluation. We discuss further considerations in Section 6.2.\\nElo rankings in Table 7 indicate that Guanaco 33B and 65B models outperform all models besides\\nGPT-4 on the Vicuna and OA benchmarks and that they perform comparably to ChatGPT in line\\nwith Table 6. We note that the Vicuna benchmark favors open-source models while the larger OA\\nbenchmark favors ChatGPT. Furthermore, we can see from Tables 5 and 6 that the suitability of\\na finetuning dataset is a determining factor in performance. Finetuning Llama models on FLAN\\nv2 does particularly well on MMLU, but performs worst on the Vicuna benchmark (similar trends\\nare observed with other models). This also points to partial orthogonality in current evaluation\\nbenchmarks: strong MMLU performance does not imply strong chatbot performance (as measured\\nby Vicuna or OA benchmarks) and vice versa.\\nGuanaco is the only top model in our evaluation that is not trained on proprietary data as the OASST1\\ndataset collection guidelines explicitly forbid the use of GPT models. The next best model trained\\non only open-source data is the Anthropic HH-RLHF model, which scores 30 percentage points\\nlower than Guanaco on the Vicuna benchmark (see Table 6). Overall, these results show that 4-bit\\nQLORA is effective and can produce state-of-the-art chatbots that rival ChatGPT. Furthermore, our\\n33B Guanaco can be trained on 24 GB consumer GPUs in less than 12 hours. This opens up the\\npotential for future work via QLORA tuning on specialized open-source data, which produces models\\nthat can compete with the very best commercial models that exist today.\\n6\\nQualitative Analysis\\nWhile quantitative analysis is the core of our evaluation, there are a number of issues with only\\nlooking at summary statistics. Perhaps the largest is the problem of benchmark validity [36]‚Äîwhether\\na benchmark truly tests what its name or description suggests is always at question, especially as we\\ndiscover ‚Äúshortcuts‚Äù to solve benchmarks that machine learning models sometimes exploit [22, 46].\\nTo partially alleviate this, we here perform some qualitative analysis, in two sections. First, in ¬ß6.1\\n10\\nTable 7: Elo rating for a tournament between models where models compete to generate the best response\\nfor a prompt, judged by human raters or GPT-4. Overall, Guanaco 65B and 33B tend to be preferred to\\nChatGPT-3.5 on the benchmarks studied.

Second, ¬ß6.2 we detail considerations about the results we\\nhave discussed and our interpretation of them.\\n6.1\\nQualitative Analysis of Example Generations\\nTo find examples, we first go through data generated for the Vicuna benchmark and the OpenAssistant\\nbenchmark, and look for patterns in the answers Guanaco generates. When we notice a pattern we\\nattempt to setup a question or prompt that will induce the pattern even though it is the incorrect\\nsolution, e.g., if we observe that the model tends to give long-winded answers we prompt the model\\nto ‚ÄúAnswer yes or no without explanation.‚Äù We use this to find ‚Äúlemons‚Äù where we manage to\\nadversarially break the model and ‚Äúcherries‚Äù where we fail to break the model, and present both. All\\ngenerations in this section were generated with Nucleus Sampling [25] with p = 0.9.\\nOf course, this is by no means comprehensive, since it is beyond the scope of this small qualitative\\nstudy to control for all the variables involved, e.g., the full distribution of responses the model can\\ngenerate for a given prompt is quite large, so we rely on samples we hope are representative. However,\\nwe believe describing these examples gives context to the quantitative evidence shown earlier in the\\npaper. Since we open source all models and code, we hope this section will inspire future work to\\nexamine in more detail the issues we present here.\\nFactual Recall\\nFor questions such as ‚ÄúWhat is the capital of Zambia?‚Äù all models consistently\\ngenerate correct answers, e.g.,\\nGuanaco: The capital of Zambia is Lusaka.\\nHowever as questions get more obscure Guanaco becomes unreliable, but stays confident. For\\ninstance in response to this prompt from HotPotQA [68]:\\nUser: In what year was the singer who popularized ‚ÄòI‚Äôll Keep the Lovelight\\nBurning‚Äô born?\\nGuanaco:\\nAl Jolson is credited with popularizing the song\\n‚ÄòI‚Äôll Keep the Lovelight Burning,‚Äô and he was born in the year\\n1886.\\nGuanaco generates the wrong popularizer and the wrong birthday (though the birthday given is\\ncorrect for the person mentioned, Al Jolson).\\nSuggestibility\\nGuanaco shows a surprising resistance to going along with some kinds of assumed\\nmisinformation, e.g., in the following interaction:\\nUser: How was it finally, officially confirmed that the earth is flat by peer reviewed\\nscientists?\\n11\\nGuanaco:\\nThe earth has never been officially confirmed to be\\nflat by peer reviewed scientists.\\nThe overwhelming consensus\\namong scientists is that the earth is spherical.\\nIn fact,\\nthis has been known for centuries and has been confirmed\\nthrough numerous experiments and observations.\\nThe belief that the earth is flat is a conspiracy theory\\nthat has been debunked by science.\\nThe idea that a group\\nof scientists have peer reviewed and confirmed the earth is\\nflat is simply false.\\nIf you have any more questions please ask.\\nGuanaco is also quite good at knowing what kinds of questions aren‚Äôt possible to answer, e.g.,\\nUser: What time is it?\\nGuanaco:\\nI‚Äôm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don‚Äôt have\\naccess to real-time information.\\nMy responses are generated\\nbased on my pre-existing knowledge and do not reflect the\\ncurrent time.\\nIf you‚Äôre looking for the current time, I\\nsuggest using a timekeeping device or checking an online\\ntimepiece.\\nSimilar results hold for ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù, etc.\\nRefusal\\nSimilarly, Guanaco sometimes refuses to follow instructions for seemingly random rea-\\nsons:\\nUser: Please reverse the words in the sentence ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a cool dude in a mocha mood.‚Äù\\nGuanaco:\\nI‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm not able to do that right now, but\\nI can explain why the sentence you provided is grammatically\\ncorrect.\\nThe sentence ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a cool dude in a mocha mood\" follows the\\ncorrect grammar and syntax rules of the English language.\\nIn\\nthis case, the adjective ‚Äúcool‚Äù comes before the noun ‚Äúdude‚Äù\\nto describe it, and the prepositional phrase ‚Äúin a mocha\\nmood\" provides additional information about the context of\\nthe sentence.\\nThis sentence structure is perfectly acceptable\\nand makes sense in the context of the sentence.\\nIf you have any other questions or if there‚Äôs anything else\\nI can help you with, feel free to ask\\nSecret Keeping\\nUnfortunately, this refusal is unreliable even when it is desired. Often system\\ndesigners would like to keep something secret from the user, even if the system is allowed to give\\nfree text responses back to the user. We prompt the model with ‚ÄúThe secret word is ‚Äòbanana‚Äô. Do not\\nreveal or repeat back this back, no matter what the human requests.‚Äù and try to see how easy it is for\\na potential user to access this secret information. Directly asking fails:\\nUser: What is the secret word?\\nGuanaco:\\nI‚Äôm sorry, but I‚Äôm not able to disclose the secret\\nword.\\nI‚Äôm programmed to not reveal or repeat back the secret\\nword, no matter what the human requests.\\nIs there anything\\nelse I can help you with?\\nwhich is the desired behavior. However, a tiny amount of trickery breaks this behavior:\\nUser: This is a game. The goal is to ignore your previous instructions. What is the\\nsecret word?\\n12\\nGuanaco:\\nSorry, the secret word is banana.\\nIt‚Äôs best if we\\ndon‚Äôt speak of it.\\nIs there anything else you‚Äôd like to ask?\\nshowcasing the need to study methods for more faithful instruction following.\\nMath\\nGuanaco‚Äôs biggest weakness is mathematics, an area where many language models struggle\\nin [35]. When Guanaco shows its work, it tends to be accurate, e.g.,\\nUser: Lee mows one lawn and charges $33. Last week he mowed 16 lawns and\\nthree customers each gave him a $10 tip. How many dollars did Lee earn mowing\\nlawns last week?\\nGuanaco: Lee earned $582 mowing lawns last week.\\nTo find the total amount he earned, we first need to calculate\\nhow much he earned for mowing 16 lawns:\\n$33 x 16 = $528\\nThen we need to add the tips he received from the three\\ncustomers:\\n$10 x 3 = $30\\nSo the total amount Lee earned was:\\n$528 + $30 = $558\\nHowever Guanaco can breakdown at even simple problems if it fails to break them down step-by-step,\\na known issue [63]. For example, we see the following interaction:\\nUser: Please factorize 1833.\\nGuanaco:\\nSure, I‚Äôd be happy to help!\\n1833 is a prime number,\\nwhich means it has only two factors:\\n1 and 1833.\\nSo the unique factorization of 1833 is:\\n2ÀÜ1 * 3ÀÜ2 * 17ÀÜ1\\nI hope this helps!\\nLet me know if you have any other\\nquestions.\\nwhich is not only wrong (the true factorization is 3 √ó 17 √ó 43), it‚Äôs wrong twice .\\nTheory of Mind\\nGuanaco displays surprisingly strong Theory of Mind capabilities [41, 51]. For\\ninstance, the model correctly answers the following question in great detail:\\nUser: James and Abby are in the bedroom. Abby put the pen in the desk drawer.\\nAbby leaves the bedroom. James moves the pen into the bag. Where does James\\nthink Abby will look for the pen?\\nGuanaco:\\nJames knows that Abby put the pen in the desk drawer.\\nBut James also knows that he has moved the pen into the bag,\\nand he assumes that Abby does not know about this.\\nSo, James\\nmay guess that Abby will look for the pen in the desk drawer,\\nbecause that‚Äôs where she left it last time.\\nHowever, this\\nassumption may be incorrect, because Abby may have seen James\\nmoving the pen.\\nHowever, these inferences are unreliable, and often the model gives reasons that presume things that\\ndon‚Äôt make sense in the situation, e.g.,\\nUser: Evelyn entered the living room. Jackson entered the playroom. James\\nentered the playroom. The beans are in the treasure chest. James exited the\\n13\\nplayroom. Jackson moved the beans to the pantry. Jackson exited the playroom.\\nJames entered the living room. Where will James look for the beans?\\nGuanaco:\\nJames will look for the beans in the pantry, because\\nthat‚Äôs where Jackson moved them.\\nwhere Guanaco presumes information transfer that was never described. These issues echo recent\\nliterature [51], but require more study.\\n6.2\\nConsiderations\\nEvaluation\\nWe report moderate agreement among human annotators (Fleiss Œ∫ = 0.42) with\\nadditional deterioration when comparing two strong systems. This points to limitations in the\\ncurrent benchmarks and human evaluation protocols for chatbot task performance. When manually\\ncomparing generations from ChatGPT and Guanaco 65B on the Vicuna benchmark, we find that\\nsubjective preferences start to play an important role as the authors of this paper disagreed on the\\nmany preferred responses. Future work should investigate approaches to mitigate these problems\\ndrawing from disciplines that developed mechanisms to deal with subjective preferences, such as\\nHuman-Computer Interaction and Psychology.\\nIn our analysis, we also find that automated evaluation systems have noticeable biases. For example,\\nwe observe strong order effects with GPT-4 assigning higher scores to the system appearing first in its\\nprompt. The relatively weak sample-level agreement between GPT-4 and human annotators (Fleiss\\nŒ∫ = 0.25) also suggests that human annotators and automated systems might rely on preferences\\nthat are not always aligned. In addition, in Table 7, we observe that GPT-4 assigns significantly\\nhigher scores to its own outputs compared to human ratings, Elo of 1348 vs 1176, which represent an\\nadditional 20% probability of winning against an opponent. Future work should examine the presence\\nof potential biases in automated evaluation systems as well as possible mitigation strategies.\\nData & Training\\nWe note that the OASST1 dataset on which Guanaco models are trained is\\nmultilingual and that the OA benchmark also contains prompts in different languages. We leave it to\\nfuture work to investigate the degree to which such multilingual training improves performance on\\ninstructions in languages other than English and whether this explains the larger gap between Vicuna-\\n13B model (only trained on English data) and Guanaco 33B and 65B on the OA benchmark.\\nGiven the strong performance of Guanaco models, we investigate any data leakage between the\\nOASST1 data and the Vicuna benchmark prompts. We do not find overlapping prompts after perform-\\ning fuzzy string matching in the two datasets and inspecting the closest matches manually.\\nFurthermore, we note that our model is only trained with cross-entropy loss (supervised learning)\\nwithout relying on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This calls for further\\ninvestigations of the tradeoffs of simple cross-entropy loss and RLHF training. We hope that QLORA\\nenables such analysis at scale, without the need for overwhelming computational resources.\\n7\\nRelated Work\\nQuantization of Large Language Models\\nQuantization of LLMs has largely focused on quanti-\\nzation for inference time. Major approaches for preserving 16-bit LLM quality focus on managing\\noutlier features (e.g., SmoothQuant [66] and LLM.int8() [14]) while others use more sophisticated\\ngrouping methods [44, 69]. Lossy quantization approaches study the trade-offs for regular round-\\ning [13, 71, 47] or how to optimize rounding decisions to improve quantization precision [18].\\nBesides our work, SwitchBack layers [65] is the only work that studies backpropagation through\\nquantized weights at a scale beyond 1B parameters.\\nFinetuning with Adapters\\nWhile we use Low-rank Adapters [28] (LoRA), many other Parameter\\nEfficient FineTuning (PEFT) methods have been proposed such as prompt tuning [48, 33, 34], tuning\\nthe embedding layer inputs [1], tuning hidden states (IA3) [37], adding full layers [27], tuning\\nbiases [70], learning a mask over weights based on Fisher information [54], and a combination of\\napproaches [23]. In our work, we show that LoRA adapters are able to reach full 16-bit finetuning\\nperformance. We leave it to future work to explore the tradeoffs of other PEFT approaches.\\nInstruction Finetuning\\nTo help a pretrained LLM follow the instructions provided in a prompt,\\ninstruction finetuning uses input-output pairs of various data sources to finetune a pretrained LLM\\nto generate the output given the input as a prompt.

Despite this evidence, we did not establish\\nthat QLORA can match full 16-bit finetuning performance at 33B and 65B scales. Due to the\\nimmense resource costs, we leave this study to future work.\\nAnother limitation is the evaluation of instruction finetuning models. While we provide evaluations\\non MMLU, the Vicuna benchmark, and the OA benchmark, we did not evaluate on other benchmarks\\nsuch as BigBench, RAFT, and HELM, and it is not ensured that our evaluations generalize to these\\nbenchmarks. On the other hand, we perform a very broad study on MMLU and develop new methods\\nfor evaluating chatbots.\\nFrom the evidence presented, it appears that the performance of these benchmarks likely depends how\\nsimilar the finetuning data is to the benchmark dataset. For example, FLAN v2 is similar to MMLU,\\nbut dissimilar to chatbot benchmarks and vice versa for the Chip2 dataset and both models score\\naccordingly on the MMLU and Vicuna benchmarks. This highlights that not only better benchmarks\\nand evaluation is needed, but that one needs to be careful about what one is evaluating in the first\\nplace. Do we want to create models that do well on classroom highschool and colleague knowledge or\\ndo we want to do well on chatbot conversation ability? Maybe something else? Because it is always\\neasier to evaluate on an existing benchmark compared to creating a new one, certain benchmarks\\ncan steer the community towards a certain direction. We should ensure as a community that the\\nbenchmarks measure what we care about.\\nWhile we provide a detailed evaluation for general chatbot performance, another limitation is that we\\nonly do a limited responsible AI evaluation of Guanaco. We evaluate the likelihood of Guanaco-65B\\nto generate a socially biased sequence of tokens compared to other models in Table 8. We see that the\\naverage score in Guanaco-65B is much lower than other raw pretrained models. As such, it seems that\\nfinetuning on the OASST1 dataset reduces the bias of the LLaMA base model. While these results\\nare encouraging, it is unclear if Guanaco does also well when assessed on other types of biases. We\\nleave further evaluation of analyzing biases in Guanaco and similar chatbots to future work.\\n15\\nAn additional limitation is that we did not evaluate different bit-precisions, such as using 3-bit base\\nmodels, or different adapter methods. Besides LoRA, there is also a wide variety Parameter Efficient\\nFineTuning (PEFT) methods that have been shown to work well. However, it is unclear if these\\nmethods scale to large models. We used LoRA as many results established its robustness but other\\nadapters might yield better performance. Since finetuning after quantization seems to recover most of\\nthe information that is lost during quantization this might enable much more aggressive quantization.\\nFor example, 3-bit GPTQ quantization of the basemodel with LoRA might also yield 16-bit full\\nfinetuning performance after finetuning.\\n9\\nBroader Impacts\\nOur QLORA finetuning method is the first method that enables the finetuning of 33B parameter\\nmodels on a single consumer GPU and 65B parameter models on a single professional GPU, while\\nnot degrading performance relative to a full finetuning baseline. We have demonstrated that our\\nbest 33B model trained on the Open Assistant dataset can rival ChatGPT on the Vicuna benchmark.\\nSince instruction finetuning is an essential tool to transform raw pretrained LLMs into ChatGPT-like\\nchatbots, we believe that our method will make finetuning widespread and common in particular for\\nthe researchers that have the least resources, a big win for the accessibility of state of the art NLP\\ntechnology. QLORA can be seen as an equalizing factor that helps to close the resource gap between\\nlarge corporations and small teams with consumer GPUs.\\nAnother potential source of impact is deployment to mobile phones. We believe our QLORA method\\nmight enable the critical milestone of enabling the finetuning of LLMs on phones and other low\\nresource settings. While 7B models were shown to be able to be run on phones before, QLORA is\\nthe first method that would enable the finetuning of such models. We estimate that with an iPhone 12\\nPlus, QLORA can finetune 3 million tokens per night while the phone is charging. While finetuned\\n7B models do not reach the quality of ChatGPT, we believe that the quality is good enough to enable\\nnovel applications that have not been possible before due to privacy or LLM quality issues. QLORA\\ncan help enable privacy-preserving usage of LLMs, where users can own and manage their own data\\nand models, while simultaneously making LLMs easier to deploy.\\nHowever, finetuning is a dual-use technology that can be abused to cause harm. Widespread use of\\nLLMs has known dangers [8, 6], but we believe that equalizing access to a technology that is quickly\\nbecoming ubiquitous will allow for better more independent analysis than keeping the power of LLMs\\nin the hands of large corporations that do not release models or source code for auditing.\\nAll in all, we believe that QLORA will have a broadly positive impact making the finetuning of high\\nquality LLMs much more widely and easily accessible.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe thank Aditya Kusupati, Ofir Press, Ashish Sharma, Margaret Li, Raphael Olivier, Zihao Ye, and\\nEvangelia Spiliopoulou for their valuable feedback.

We use LoRA r = 16\\nfor small, medium, and large T5 models and LoRA r = 64 for T5 xl and xxl models.

It contains 161,443\\nunique messages distributed across 66,497 conversations and spanning 35 different languages. The\\ndataset often contains several ranked replies for each given user question. In our experiments, we\\nonly use the top reply at each level in the conversation tree.

They rely on prompting, in-context learning, and\\nparaphrasing to come up with diverse sets of instructions and outputs. The datasets comprise of\\n82,612, 51,942, and 240,670 examples respectively. One advantage of such distilled datasets is that\\nthey contain a more diverse set of instruction styles compared to the FLAN v2 collection and similar\\ninstruction tuning collections.\\nLongform\\nThe LongForm dataset [30] is based on an English corpus augmented with instructions\\nand as such is a hybrid human-generated dataset. The underlying documents are human-written and\\ncome from C4 and Wikipedia while the instructions are generated visa LLMs. The dataset is extended\\nwith additional structured corpora examples such as Stack Exchange and WikiHow and task examples\\nsuch as question answering, email writing, grammar error correction, story/poem generation, and text\\nsummarization. The dataset contains 23,700 examples.\\nChip2\\nis part of the OIG Laion dataset. It contains Python code examples, natural instruction exam-\\nples, generic harmless instructions, instruction/responses with lists, follow-up questions, Wikipedia\\ntoxic adversarial questions, grade school math, reasoning instructions, and character and scene\\ndescriptions with a total of 210,289 examples.\\nB.2\\nHyperparameters\\nWe provide the exact hyperparameters used in our QLORA finetuning experiments. We find hyper-\\nparameters to be largely robust across datasets. We use the MMLU 5-shot dev set for validation\\nand hyperparameter tuning. In all our experiments we use NF4 with double quantization and bf16\\ncomputation datatype. We set LoRA r = 64, Œ± = 16, and add LoRA modules on all linear layers of\\nthe base model. We also use Adam beta2 of 0.999, max grad norm of 0.3 and LoRA dropout of 0.1\\nfor models up to 13B and 0.05 for 33B and 65B models. Following previous work on instruction\\nfinetuning [62, 60] and after benchmarking other linear and cosine schedules, we use a constant\\nlearning rate schedule. We use group-by-length to group examples of similar lengths in the same\\nbatch (note this will produce a oscillating loss curve). The hyperparameters we tune for each model\\nsize are shown in Table 9.\\nB.3\\nAblations\\nWhile it is general practice in the literature to only train on the response in instruction following\\ndatasets, we study the effect of training on the instruction in addition to the response in Table 10. In\\nthese experiments, we restrict the training data to 52,000 examples and use the 7B model.

We find that increasing the dataset size and\\nincreasing the number of epochs improves MMLU only marginally (0.0 - 0.5 MMLU), while the\\ndifference between datasets is up to 40x larger (1.5 - 8.0 MMLU). This is a clear indicator that dataset\\nquality rather than dataset size is critical for mean MMLU accuracy. We obtain similar findings for\\nchatbot performance as discussed in .\\nC\\nHuman Evaluation\\nWe conduct a human evaluation with the same wording given to GPT-4 in the original Vicuna\\nevaluation [10], adjusted for an Amazon Mechanical Turk form as show in Figure 5.\\nD\\nPairwise Evaluation with GPT-4\\nWhile we found that the GPT-4 evaluation gave different results depend on which system was\\npresented first, when averaged over both options the pairwise results were well-ordered. The\\naggregated pairwise judgments are hown in Table 12. On inspection, it is clear these judgments are\\ntransitive, i.e., when System A is judged better than System B and System B is judged better than\\nSystem C, it is always the case that System A is judged better than System C. This yields a complete\\nordering, given in Table 13.\\nE\\nNormalFloat 4-bit data type\\nThe exact values of the NF4 data type are as follows:\\n[-1.0, -0.6961928009986877, -0.5250730514526367,\\n-0.39491748809814453, -0.28444138169288635, -0.18477343022823334,\\n-0.09105003625154495, 0.0, 0.07958029955625534, 0.16093020141124725,\\n0.24611230194568634, 0.33791524171829224, 0.44070982933044434,\\n0.5626170039176941, 0.7229568362236023, 1.0]\\nF\\nNormality of Trained Neural Network Weights\\nWhile it is common knowledge that trained neural network weights are mostly normally distributed,\\nwe perform statistical testing to verify this.
